## Synopsis

My second project while studying code was to build a chat application. This application is coded to allow users to add new chatrooms, update messages and chat in their selected room. Firebase was used to authenticate each user.  The page was styled using Material UI. It is mobile responsive, though it is best used on a desktop platform.
