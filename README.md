## Synopsis

Bloc Chat was built as my second project using React.  The app was first built by creating a list of chat rooms that dynamically updates when a user adds a new chat room. After that, displayed messages for each chat room were generated. Firebase was added for user authentication and to save messages for each user. All messages only display within the given chat room in which they were created. Messages and chat rooms may be deleted and edited when necessary. The page was styled using Material UI. It is mobile responsive, though it is best used on a desktop platform.
